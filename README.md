## About this project
Have you ever been scrolling on TikTok and found a review of a restaurant you'd love to visit?  That's where Taste of TikTok comes in handy!  Save TikTok restaurant reviews and their corresponding restaurants in the app, then when you're hungry return to the app and find added restaurants!
